# Final-Project

To Run this game, the you must install Pygame and pyserial in Python and JRE Flip software for the Arduino Uno to be used as an HID controller.

Pygame Installation:

Conda - conda install pyserial

Next, download all python code and arduino files. (Pong.py for single and multiplayer) & (Main.py, paddle.py, and ball.py for multiplayer)
Make connections using an Arduino and Push Buttons.
Follow Instructions from How to turn the ATMEGA chip of an Arduino Uno and Arduino Mega into a HID keyboard device.pdf to turn the Arduino into HID Controller.

If more info needed, refer to ArduinoHIDKeyboard folder. Construct circuit based on Circuit Diagram pdf.

Run Game in main.py file.
