# Final-Project

To Run this game, the you must install Pygame and pyserial in Python and JRE Flip software for the Arduino Uno to be used as an HID controller.

Pygame Installation:
Python - pip install pygame
Conda - conda install pygame

Pyserial Installation:
Python - pip install pyserial
Conda - conda install pyserial

Next, download all python code and arduino files. (Pong.py for single/multiplayer) & (main.py, paddle.py, and ball.py for single player)
Construct circuit based on Circuit Diagram pdf. Make connections on a breadboard using an Arduino, Push Buttons, and Potentiometer.

Follow Instructions from How to turn the ATMEGA chip of an Arduino Uno and Arduino Mega into a HID keyboard device.pdf to turn the Arduino into HID Controller.

If more info needed, refer to the google slides presentation.

Run Game in pong.py file.




Pong is one of the first computer games that ever created, this simple "tennis like" game features two paddles and a ball, the goal is to defeat your opponent by being the first one to gainv10 point, a player gets a point once the opponent misses a ball.
